# Visual Studio Code - iTunes & Apple Music Player

Control iTunes or Apple Music From Within With Visual Studio Code.

This is a fork of the original from [PsykoSoldi3r](https://github.com/PsykoSoldi3r/vscode-itunes), as the project appears to have been abandoned. This version adds many settings and custom formatting options.
